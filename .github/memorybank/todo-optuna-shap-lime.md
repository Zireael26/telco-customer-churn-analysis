# To-Do List: Optuna Re-Enable, SHAP Removal, LIME Retention

## Completed Steps
- [x] Analyzed `src/main.py` for Optuna, SHAP, and LIME integration points
- [x] Removed SHAP interpretability logic from pipeline
- [x] Re-enabled Optuna for TensorFlow TabNet hyperparameter tuning
- [x] Kept LIME interpretability logic

## Next Steps
- [ ] Fix missing imports and undefined variables (e.g., keras, numpy, sklearn, lime, matplotlib, seaborn)
- [ ] Ensure all required packages are installed in the environment
- [ ] Test the updated pipeline for successful training, tuning, and LIME interpretability
- [ ] Update documentation/comments for new pipeline logic
- [ ] Update memory bank with summary of changes and current status
