# Memory Bank Update: Optuna Re-Enable, SHAP Removal, LIME Retention

## Actions Taken
- Analyzed `src/main.py` for integration points of Optuna, SHAP, and LIME.
- Removed all SHAP interpretability logic from the pipeline for speed and efficiency.
- Re-enabled Optuna for hyperparameter tuning, adapting the objective function for TensorFlow TabNet.
- Retained LIME interpretability logic as requested.

## Challenges
- Multiple missing imports and undefined variables detected (e.g., keras, numpy, sklearn, lime, matplotlib, seaborn).
- Environment may require installation of several packages for successful execution.

## Current Status
- Pipeline logic updated as per user request.
- To-Do list created and updated for next steps (fix imports, install packages, test pipeline, update docs).
- Ready to proceed with fixing imports and running the updated pipeline.
