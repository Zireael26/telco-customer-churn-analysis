# Feature Engineering To-Do List

## Context
This To-Do list tracks the implementation of feature engineering for the TabNet integration project, as outlined in the plan and memory bank.

## Tasks

- [x] Review data exploration findings and identify candidate features (done in notebook)
- [x] Implement and validate feature engineering steps in the notebook (`notebooks/feature_engineering.ipynb`)
- [x] Add visualizations and markdown explanations for new features in the notebook
- [x] Implement feature engineering as a script in `src/engineer/feature_engineering.py`
- [ ] Ensure script is modular, well-documented, and follows best practices
- [x] Test script with dataloader and sample data
- [x] Update memory bank with new features, rationale, and status
- [x] Confirm all steps are reproducible and robust

## Next Action
- Proceed to TabNet model integration and training pipeline as per the implementation plan.
