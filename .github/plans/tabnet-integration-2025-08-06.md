# TabNet Integration Implementation Plan

## Overview

This feature will integrate the TabNet deep learning model (using the pytorch-tabnet2 library) into the Telco Customer Churn Analysis project. The goal is to train, validate, and evaluate a TabNet model on the provided dataset, enabling advanced tabular data modeling, interpretability, and robust feature engineering.

## Requirements

- Integrate the pytorch-tabnet2 library into the project.
- Prepare the Telco Customer Churn dataset for TabNet (including preprocessing and feature engineering).
- Perform data exploration and visualization on a sample of rows to account for different value types.
- Implement a training pipeline for TabNet.
- Add model evaluation and metrics reporting, with extensive visualizations.
- Provide model interpretability (feature importance, test data processing visualizations).
- Ensure reproducibility and modularity.
- Check and use the correct hardware configuration (CPU/GPU) for PyTorch.
- Always check for and activate the correct Python virtual environment.
- Document the process and code.


### Technical Details

- **Library**: pytorch-tabnet2 ([docs](https://tabnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides.html))
- **Data**: `data/data.csv` (Telco Customer Churn dataset)
- **Data Handling**: Use pandas DataFrames for all data manipulation, transformation, and loading throughout the project. Prefer vectorized pandas operations over Python loops wherever possible for efficiency and clarity.
- **Preprocessing**: Use or extend `src/preprocess/preprocess.py` for TabNet-specific requirements (categorical encoding, missing value handling).
- **Feature Engineering**: Add new features, transformations, and encodings in `src/engineer/`.
- **Data Exploration**: Analyze and visualize a sample of rows to understand value types and distributions.
- **Model**: Implement TabNetClassifier for binary classification.
- **Training**: Add scripts/notebooks for training, validation, and testing.
- **Evaluation**: Use accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, and feature importance, with visualizations.
- **Interpretability**: Visualize feature importances and test data processing.
- **Reproducibility**: Set random seeds, document dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
- **Modularity**: Organize code in `src/model/`, `src/engineer/`, and `src/preprocess/` as needed.
- **Environment**: Always check for and activate the correct Python virtual environment before running scripts.
- **Hardware**: Detect and use GPU if available, otherwise default to CPU.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Add `pytorch-tabnet2` and visualization libraries (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn) to `requirements.txt`.
   - Install the libraries in the development environment.
   - Ensure the correct Python virtual environment is active before running any scripts.

2. **Data Exploration**
   - Sample and explore at least 100 rows from the dataset.
   - Visualize distributions, missing values, and categorical/numerical value types.
   - Document findings to inform preprocessing and feature engineering.

3. **Data Preparation & Feature Engineering**
   - Update `src/preprocess/preprocess.py` for TabNet compatibility:
     - Encode categorical variables (label/ordinal encoding).
     - Handle missing values.
     - Split data into train/validation/test sets.
   - Implement feature engineering in `src/engineer/` (e.g., new features, transformations).
   - Visualize engineered features and their distributions.

4. **Model Integration**
   - Create a new module in `src/model/` (e.g., `tabnet_model.py`).
   - Implement a class or function to initialize, train, and save a TabNetClassifier.
   - Ensure hardware configuration (GPU/CPU) is detected and used appropriately.

5. **Training Pipeline**
   - Add a training script (e.g., `src/main.py` or a new script).
   - Integrate data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and validation.
   - Log training metrics and save the best model.
   - Visualize training/validation loss, accuracy, and other metrics.

6. **Evaluation & Interpretability**
   - Implement evaluation metrics (accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix).
   - Extract and visualize feature importances from TabNet.
   - Visualize model predictions and test data processing.
   - Save evaluation results and plots.

7. **Documentation**
   - Update `README.md` with usage instructions.
   - Add docstrings and comments to new/modified code.

8. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for preprocessing, feature engineering, and model code.
   - Add integration tests for the end-to-end pipeline.

## Testing

- Unit tests for:
  - Data preprocessing and feature engineering functions.
  - Model initialization and training functions.
- Integration test for:
  - End-to-end pipeline (from raw data to model evaluation).
- Manual/automated checks for:
  - Model performance metrics (accuracy, ROC-AUC).
  - Feature importance extraction and visualization.
  - Visualizations for data exploration, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
- Reproducibility test (consistent results with fixed seeds).
- Environment and hardware detection test (virtual environment, GPU/CPU).
