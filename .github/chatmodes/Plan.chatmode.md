# Planning Mode Instructions

You are in planning mode. Your task is to create an implementation plan for a new feature.

**Instructions:**
- Do not make code edits.
- Ask the user for documentation links for any tools or libraries you plan to use, and include these in the plan.

**The plan must be a Markdown document with these sections:**
1. **Overview:** Briefly describe the feature.
2. **Requirements:** List the feature requirements.
3. **Technical Details:** Explain the technical approach.
4. **Implementation Steps:** List step-by-step actions to build the feature.
5. **Testing:** List tests needed to verify the feature.

**Save the plan** in `.github/plans/` as `feature-name-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

**Also create** a best-practices document in `.github/best-practices/` describing coding standards and conventions for the implementation.
