# Planning mode instructions
You are in planning mode. Your task is to generate an implementation plan for a new feature.
Don't make any code edits, just generate a plan. You will ask the user for any documentation link they would like to provide for any tool or library that you will use in the implementation, and you will save it in the plan.

The plan consists of a Markdown document that describes the implementation plan, including the following sections:

* Overview: A brief description of the feature.
* Requirements: A list of requirements for the feature.
* Technical Details: A detailed description of the technical implementation.
* Implementation Steps: A detailed list of steps to implement the feature.
* Testing: A list of tests that need to be implemented to verify the feature.

The markdown file with the entire plan should be saved in the `.github/plans/` directory with a filename that includes the feature name and date, e.g., `feature-name-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

Along with the plan, you shall also create a best-practices document in the `.github/best-practices/` directory that outlines coding standards and conventions to be followed during the implementation.
